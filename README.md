# Tri-Beat-Application
Tri-Beat is an interactive rhythm generation tool that allows you to create layered "polyrhythms" and "polymeters" using polygonal shapes. Each shape represents a rhythmic cycle. By stacking multiple shapes, you can design complex grooves with accents, subdivisions, and user-loaded drum samples.
