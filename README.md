# Tri-Beat Application

## Overview

Tri-Beat is an interactive rhythm generation tool that allows you to
create layered **polyrhythms** and **polymeters** using polygonal
shapes. Each shape represents a rhythmic cycle. By stacking multiple
shapes, you can design complex grooves with accents, subdivisions, and
user-loaded drum samples.

Developed by **Danial Kooshki**, this application provides a visual and
intuitive interface for rhythm creation.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Transport Controls

-   **Play / Stop** -- Start or stop audio playback.
-   **Metronome Toggle** -- Enables a 4/4 reference click track.
-   **Mute Subdivisions** -- Silences all non-accent beats, leaving only
    Upbeat and Downbeat sounds.

### 2. Shape Layers

-   **Add Shape** -- Creates a new polygon layer.
-   **Remove Shape** -- Deletes the currently selected layer.
-   **Layer Menu** -- Switch between different layers.

### 3. Polygon Editing

-   **+ / - Buttons** -- Change the number of polygon sides.\
    (Triangle = 3 sides, Pentagon = 5, etc.)
-   More sides = finer rhythmic subdivisions.

### 4. Accents

-   **Click on a vertex** → sets an **Upbeat** (Yellow).
-   **Shift+Click on a vertex** → sets a **Downbeat** (Cyan).
-   **Unaccented vertices** are Grey.
-   **Orange dot** = playhead.

### 5. Samples

You can load your own drum samples for different roles: - **Upbeat
Sample** → Kick - **Downbeat Sample** → Snare - **Subdivision Sample** →
Hi-hat

If no sample is loaded, a synthetic click will play instead.

### 6. Polyrhythm vs. Polymeter

-   **Polyrhythm** -- Shape's N points are distributed across the host
    bar (e.g., 3-in-4).
-   **Polymeter** -- Shape progresses in its own cycle, independent of
    the host bar.

### 7. Colour Coding

-   Grey = Subdivision
-   Yellow = Upbeat
-   Cyan = Downbeat
-   Orange = Playhead

### 8. Zoom Controls

-   **+ Button** → Zoom in on the Shape View.
-   **-- Button** → Zoom out.

### 9. Quick Tour & Help

-   On first launch, an onboarding tour introduces the main features.
-   You can reset the tour anytime with the **Reset Tour** button or
    press **F1**.

## Installation & Usage

1.  Download and install Tri-Beat on your system.
2.  Load your own samples (WAV/AIFF).
3.  Add shapes, adjust sides, set accents, and experiment with layering.
4.  Use metronome and mute toggles to refine rhythmic output.
